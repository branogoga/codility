My solutions of Codility lessons in C++

To build and run use Visual Studio solution Lessons.sln. 
Every exercise is stored as separate project. 
Some of the lessons are not started, unfinished or suboptimal - they are always marked in project title. All other exerices are passed with 100% mark.
Every lesson has own set of test cases used for development. Test cases usually cover the default test case mentioned in the exercise, but does not have to correspond with the tests provided by the Codility engine.
